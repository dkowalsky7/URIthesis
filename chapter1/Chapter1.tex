The Current Setup supports a 5 chapter thesis. To add additional chapters, create a new chapter folder, with a new tex file. Copy and past the preamble above into the new chapters tex file. Update the \\setcounter{number}, to the chapter number. Change both \\section*{} and the \\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{CHANGE} command to the name of the new chapter. Add the chapter in the thesismain.tex file as well.
