# URIthesis

This repository was created for easy setup of a thesis or Dissertation at the University of Rhode Island. However, this is not a style file, but rather a skeleton of `.tex` files and folders to easily write and format a thesis in LaTeX. URI has a style file which can be found [here](https://web.uri.edu/ecbe/thesisguide/step2/). The URI style file was not used in creating this setup as there are some issues within the URI style file, most likely due to limited maintenance.


## Setup

Comments within the `.tex` files will aid in generating personalized changes such as setting the citation format, paper/electronic versions, or adding additional chapters. However, a few notes to get going are outlined below.

### Adding New Chapters

The current format supports a five-chapter thesis. To add additional chapters, simply create a new folder and chapter file, similar to the others. Add the chapter to the `thesismain.tex` file, in the section seen below.

    %-----------------Compile Chapter Files--------------------

    \include{chapter1/Chapter1}   %
    \include{chapter2/Chapter2}    %
    \include{chapter3/Chapter3}     % - Current Chapters -
    \include{chapter4/Chapter4}    %
    \include{chapter5/Chapter5}   %
    % Add new chapter here
    %---------------------------------------------------------

Within the new chapter `.tex` file, add the preamble seen below and update the `\setcounter{section}{#}` to the number of the new chapter. 


    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Preamble %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{center}                                                          %
	    \section*{CHAPTER 1}                                                %
	    \textbf{Name of Chapter 1}                                          %
	    \setcounter{section}{1} % <- update # with new chapter #            %
	    \setcounter{table}{0}                                               %
	    \setcounter{figure}{0}                                              %
    \end{center}                                                            %
    \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{CHAPTER 1 - Name of Chapter 1}           %
    \vspace{5mm}                                                            %
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    
### Committee Signature Pages
    
URI formatting guidelines did not specify the appropriate indentation for these pages. Because of this, these files were just generated with MS word and included as `.pdf` files. Simply open the word document within the `\intropages` folder and open `sign_pages.doc` and change the name of or add the committee members accordingly. Save the file with the `.pdf` extension to the same folder. 
    
    
## Additional Notes

As a suggestion, if you prefer to generate plots using the [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) package for Python, consider following the guidelines from [this](http://bkanuka.com/articles/native-latex-plots/) blog post for generating plots in Python that look native to LaTeX.

Please feel free to push commits to this repository to further advance the setup, as there is room for improvement. Consider, if your're interested, creating a style file to improve formatting and usability. 


Good Luck!
